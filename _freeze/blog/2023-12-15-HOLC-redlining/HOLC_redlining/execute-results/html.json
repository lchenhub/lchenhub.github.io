The United States has a long history of racial segregation which is still visible. During the 1930's the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), as part of the New Deal, rated neighborhoods based on their perceived safety for real estate investment. Their ranking system, (A (green), B (blue), C (yellow), D (red)) was then used to block access to loans for home ownership. Colloquially known as \"redlining\", this practice has had widely-documented consequences not only for community wealth, but also health (Gee 2008). Redlined neighborhoods have less greenery and are hotter than other neighborhoods (Nardone, 2021; Hoffman, 2020).\n\nCheck out coverage by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html).\n\nA recent study found that redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to, it has also shaped our observations of biodiversity (Ellis-Soto, 2023). Community or citizen science, whereby individuals share observations of species, is generating an enormous volume of data. Ellis-Soto and co-authors found that historically redlining neighborhoods remain the most undersampled areas across 195 US cities. This gap is highly concerning, because conservation decisions are made based on these data.\n\nCheck out coverage by [EOS](https://eos.org/articles/bird-biodiversity-reports-reflect-cities-redlined-past?utm_source=EosBuzz&mkt_tok=OTg3LUlHVC01NzIAAAGOx3ckQPpeDY3QyFKdUnBSYqILj3qLrgb_Q2lasphwcF90xEzMgjZFUo3NHsw3caXDcZe6I8D8qdVsSRr3wzhb6LKAQRgNo8ffhjieEbDwMw).\n\nAlso check out coverage on historical redlining and its impact on bird populations in LA by [[LAist](https://laist.com/news/climate-environment/why-las-bird-populations-today-are-evidence-of-historical-redlining)].\n\n## Data\n\nThe datasets used for this analysis are listed and described below:\n\n-   EJScreen\n\n    -   This data is provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool.\n\n        According to the [US EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/purposes-and-uses-ejscreen):\n\n        -   This screening tool and data may be of interest to community residents or other stakeholders as they search for environmental or demographic information. It can also support a wide range of research and policy goals. The public has used EJScreen in many different locations and in many different ways.\n\n        -   EPA is sharing EJScreen with the public:\n\n            -   to be more transparent about how we consider environmental justice in our work\n\n            -   to assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about pursuing environmental justice and,\n\n            -   to create a common starting point between the agency and the public when looking at issues related to environmental justice.\n\n-   EJScreen\n\n    -   EJScreen provides on environmental and demographic information for the US at the Census [tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract) and [block group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group) levels. We will be working with block group data that has been downloaded from the [EPA site](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data). To understand the associated data columns, we will need to explore the Technical Documentation and column description spreadsheet available. We can also explore the [limitations and caveats](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/limitations-and-caveats-using-ejscreen) of the data.\n\n-   Mapping Inequality (University of Richmond)\n\n    -   A team of researchers, led by the [Digital Scholarship Lab](https://dsl.richmond.edu/) at the University of Richmond have digitized maps and information from the HOLC as part of the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58) project.\n\n        Maps of HOLC grade designations for Los Angeles will be used. Information on the data can be found [here](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=downloads) (Robert 2023).\n\n-   Global Biodiversity Information Facility\n\n    -   The [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org) is the largest aggregator of biodiversity observations in the world. Observations typically include a location and date that a species was observed.\n\n        Observations of birds from 2021 onward will be used.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\n### Analysis of EJScreen data within a historical redlining context\n\nWe will investigate the legacy of redlining in current environmental (in)justice by exploring and visualize the data. Using these summaries and visualization, we can then draw conclusions on our research question.\n\n### Import and explore data\n\nFirst, we need to load the relevant packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the libraries needed for the analysis\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(spData)\nlibrary(spDataLarge)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tmap)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we will read in EJScreen data and filter to Los Angeles County.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in geodatabase of EJScreen data at the Census Block Group level\nejscreen <- st_read(\"data/EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb/\") \n\n#check class of ejscreen\nclass(ejscreen)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter to Los Angeles County\nla_county <- ejscreen %>%\n  filter(CNTY_NAME %in% c(\"Los Angeles County\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now make a map of wastewater discharge by census block groups.

While lower than pm2.5, the other percentiles are still alarmingly high, given that low life expectancy and cancer are severe conditions. The percentiles for low income and cancer neighborhoods are similar and the percentile for low life expectancy is a bit lower.\n\n### Investigate the legacy of redlining in biodiversity observations\n\nFor bird observations from 2022 that fall within neighborhoods with HOLC grads, we will find the percent of observations within each redlining categories and plot results. In order to do so, we must make sure that the bird observations have the same CRS as redlining data.\n\n### Import and explore data\n\nWe will start by importing exploring data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#read in bird data from data folder\nbird <- st_read(\"data/gbif-birds-LA/gbif-birds-LA.shp\") \n\n#filter to year 2022\nbird_2022 <- bird %>% filter(year == 2022)\n\n#check crs\nst_crs(LA_redlining) == st_crs(bird) #True\n\n#intersect birds and LA redlining\nbird_red <- st_join(LA_redlining, bird_2022, join = st_intersects)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's find the percent of observations within each redlining category.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbird_holc_p <- bird_red %>% #filter into the intersected data defined above\n  st_drop_geometry() %>% #drop the geometry column  \n  group_by(grade) %>% #group by values in holc_grade column\n  summarise(percentage = n()/nrow(bird_red) * 100) #summarise these group by percentage\n\n#print\nbird_holc_p\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  grade percentage\n  <chr>      <dbl>\n1 A          15.0 \n2 B          18.8 \n3 C          34.3 \n4 D          28.1 \n5 <NA>        3.80\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's plot this to visualize the percent of bird observations within each redlining category.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# plot \nggplot(bird_holc_p, \n       aes(x=grade, y=percentage)) + #label x/y axis\n       labs(title = \"Percent of Bird Observations within each Redlining Category\") + \n       geom_col(fill = \"cornflowerblue\") #customize labels\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HOLC_redlining_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese results are surprising, given that the EOP article about birding discusses less available birding data in neighborhoods with historical redlining and its relation to decreased conservation efforts.\n\nThe graph shows that there are higher percentage of bird observations in the \"C =\"definitely declining\" category, which could suggest a few possibilities:\n\n1.  More densely populated areas are in the C category and therefore more observations were recorded;\n\n2.  That the urban infrastructure is deteriorating so much that it results in increased green spaces with suitable bird habitat, or;\n\n3.  There is increased gentrification in these areas.\n\n## References\n\n### Data\n\n1.
